<p>1. Objectives<br>It is the goal of theackersfield, to help users enter and navigate the cryptocurrency space, and provide tools to help users make their own sound decisions relative to growing their wealth. Services are intended for medium- and long-term investors.</p>
<p>2. Activities<br>2.1 Account creation</p>
<p>theackersfield will create the necessary crypto exchange accounts on behalf of, and with permission of the user. Once account set-up is complete, users are provided with the account credentials and password change instructions, at which point users will have full control over their account. Users are the full and sole owner of their exchange accounts and carry all responsibilities that come with opening, holding, and managing such accounts.</p>
<p>2.2 Asset allocation</p>
<p>theackersfield, uses dynamic, proprietary algorithms to define and perform portfolio allocation, based on user input. Manual trades or transactions conducted by users may limit theackersfield, account monitoring and reporting ability.</p>
<p>2.3 Fund deposits and withdrawals</p>
<p>Users are responsible for depositing and withdrawing funds to/from their account, however, Kale Crypto Investment will provide clear instructions on how to do so. Note: all users are expected to pay certain withdrawal fees which your account manager would inform you about.</p>
<p>2.4 Account monitoring and reporting</p>
<p>theackersfield, will continuously monitor user accounts and provide users with a monthly dashboard with easy-to-understand portfolio and performance details.</p>
<p>3. Fees<br>3.1 Fee structure</p>
<p>theackersfield offers different plans: freemium, and performance fee. The freemium plan is totally free and offers limited functionality.</p>
<p>If you choose the performance fee plan, you pay a one-off set-up fee of Eur 59, after which we won’t charge you anything until you hit 10% profit. The moment that happens theackersfield will charge you a 15% performance fee over the realized gains, and the baseline is set to the portfolio value. For example: you invest Eur 5,000 and after a while your portfolio is worth Eur 5,500 (10% profit). You will receive an invoice for the amount of Eur 75 (500 profit * 15%), and the baseline is set to Eur 5,500. To hit 10% again, your portfolio needs to reach Eur 6,050 (5,500 + 10%).</p>
<p>Our customers especially like the no-profit-no-pay model as it means that theackersfield only gets paid if the customer wins. We like this also!</p>
<p>3.2 Promotions</p>
<p>theackersfield reserves the right to apply promotional discounts to the fees listed under 3.1. This is completely at theackersfield discretion.</p>
<p>3.3 Other fees</p>
<p>theackersfield does not charge any additional or hidden fees. For any transaction or trading fees that may be charged by cryptocurrency exchanges and/or banks, users accept full responsibility.</p>
<p>4. Security<br>4.1 Infrastructure</p>
<p>theackersfield is powered by Google Cloud. Google Cloud helps reducing the cost, complexity, and risk associated with security and compliance in the cloud.</p>
<p>4.2 Exchanges</p>
<p>theackersfield thoroughly vets its partners and only works with major “top-10” exchanges. User funds remain on their personal exchange account and interactions between theackersfield and user accounts are performed by means of customer owned API keys. API access is limited, hence in the unlikely event of a security breach, no fund withdrawal can take place.</p>
