            <p class="p-3">The site (https://theackersfield.co) (hereinafter referred to as the “Site”, “Website”) is operated by theackersfield INC (Hereinafter referred to as the “Company”, “We”, “Our”). These Terms and Conditions together with all company policies and Risk Disclosure Document, as well as any legally binding document entered into between the Company and the Client, all as amended from time to time in writing, constitute a binding Agreement (hereinafter: “Agreement”) between You (Hereinafter referred to as “You”, the “Client”, “User) and the Company. Any and all activity on, with and/or via this Site shall be governed by these Terms and Conditions. By accessing, visiting and/or using this site or the services of the Company You express your consent to any and all of these Terms and Conditions and undertakes to fully comply therewith.
             <br>
             <br>
         
            This Agreement set out the terms upon which the Company will deal with the Client in respect to placing and executing financial instruments rates transactions, including Forex (Foreign Currencies), Cryptocurrencies, ETFs, Commodities, Stocks & Indices rates (“Trading“), on the Company’s trading platform, and any other service made available by the Company to the Client.
             <br>
             
         
            <b>IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ANY OF THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS OR ANY OF THE POLICIES – YOU CANNOT USE THE COMPANY’S SERVICES.
             </b>

          <br>
          <br>
         
         <b>PERMITTED USE:</b>
             <br>
             Any User must be aged 18 or older and legally permitted to use the Services this under the laws applicable to him/her in the jurisdiction in which he resides. The user represents that he or she has the full legal capacity to enter into legally binding agreements.

             <br>
          
         <br>
         <b>YOUR ACCOUNT AND THE BANK ACCOUNT:</b>
         <br>
         The Company will open an account for the Client (the “Trading Account”) as soon as Your Application Form is accepted, and provide You with a User ID and account number. You must not disclose your account access details to any other person, and in the event that You believe that these details are known by a third party then You must notify us immediately.
         <br>
         <br>

The Client confirms that all information it provides to the Company is full, accurate and complete. If there is a change in relation to any of the information provided by the Client, the Client must notify the Company immediately of any such change.
<br>
The Trading Account will be activated by the Company as soon as the Company has identified the funds credited by the Client to the Trading Account. We may carry out credit or other checks as we deem appropriate from time to time including without limit obtaining references from Your Bank (hereinafter: “Bank Account”), employer or credit agencies (if applicable). Acknowledge and accept that We are under no obligation to accept or transfer any money to or accept any money from any account other than your Bank Account.
<br>
The Company may act, according to the Company’s sole discretion, as principal or as agent on the Client’s behalf. Therefore the Company may act as the counterparty to the Clients’ Trading activity. The Client confirms that it acts as a principal and not as agent or trustee on behalf of someone else. Accordingly, the Client agrees that it shall be directly and fully responsible for performing all of the Client’s obligations under this Agreement.
<br>
Usage of the Trading Platform provided by the Company is by limited license given by the company to the client. The license is personal, non-transferable and is subject to the terms of this Agreement. The Client may not transfer, assign, and enable others to make any use of the license.
<br>
You should understand that trading, investments and similar operations are regulated in different ways throughout the world. The fact that you can access our website and use the Services the Company offers doesn’t necessarily mean that it is legal in your country to do so and that is your responsibility to verify. Your usage of the Company’s Trading Platform and Services constitute your acknowledgement that is legal for you to do so.
<br>
The account could be maintained in USD currency. Any other currency will be converted at a fair exchange rate at the discretion of the Company at the point of conversion; if the Client sends funds in another currency than his account’s currency, we will apply an exchange rate to our discretion. We will generally settle trades or perform any required setoffs and deductions in the relevant currency where the account comprises such currency ledger, save that where such currency balance is insufficient, we may settle trades in any currency using the exchange rate.
             <br>
          <br>
             <b>DEPOSITS </b>
         <br>
             The Client may transfer funds to the Company with different methods of payment as permitted by the Company from time to time and in such currency acceptable by the Company. Such funds will be converted and managed in the Trading Platform in US Dollars or EURO or Pound sterling according to an exchange rate determined by the Company’s according to the known rates at the Market.
<br>
The Funds deposited with the Company by the Client, together with any Profit or other Benefits the Client may be entitled to according to a specific agreement with the Company, shall be used as security to any Transaction, including losses, commissions and any other fee or debt owed by the Client to the Company, which will be automatically deducted from the Client’s equity in the Trading Account. The funds in the account shall not bear any interest or any other benefits (except for rollover/swap calculation). Trading in financial instruments rates does not grant the Client any right to dividends, voting, allocations or any other benefits, but may be subject to adjustments according to financial events which affect the reference security, such as distribution of dividends, splits etc.
<br>
According to anti-money-laundering laws and regulations, The Client will be required to identify itself as the origin of the funds. The Client may be required to provide such further full and true information and sign any document required by the Company to enable proper operation of the Trading Account under the applicable laws.
<br>
Whenever the Client transfers funds to the Company, those funds belong to the Company and will be treated by it as its own for the purpose of securing or covering the Client’s present, future, actual, contingent or prospective obligations, subject only to any contractual obligation of the Company to pay or return money to the Client according to the terms of this Agreement. The Client will not have a proprietary claim over money transferred to the Company, and the Company can deal with it in its own right.
<br>
The Client declares the funds do not derive from any criminal or other illegal activity and without any violation of any applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations.
             <br>
          <br>
             <b>REFUND AND WITHDRAWALS</b>
         <br>
             
             Requesting a refund or withdraw from the Company is by submitting a withdrawal request. A Client may ask to withdraw only the available funds from his account to his Bank account. Available funds means funds that are not required to secure any open position, any current or foreseen liability of the Client towards the Company and not under any other contractual obstacle such as volume conditioned bonuses etc. The Company may cancel the Client’s withdrawal order, if, according to the Company’s discretion, the remaining funds (after the withdrawal) shall not be sufficient.
<br>
Repayment of any funds by the Company to the Client will be in the same currency and to the same account/credit card from which the funds were originally transferred, unless the Company has decided, by its own discretion and subject to the applicable anti-money laundering laws, to return the funds to a different account of the Client.
<br>
The Client will have no claim against the Company and will not hold the Company responsible for any delay and/or differences originating from financial institutions (banks, credit cards, payment solutions etc.), rates calculation and/or commission and/or any other bank or credit debit.
<br>
The request will generally be processed by us within 3 business days of receipt. Once the withdrawal request has been approved it may take up to 8 business days for the funds to reach your credit card or bank account. If you do not have online access to your credit card, it should appear on the next billing statement(s) depending on your card’s billing cycle.
<br>
         <b>
The minimum amount of withdrawal via a wire transfer is 250 USD.
         </b>    
             <br>
          <br>
       <b>BONUS POLICY</b><br> 
Funds appearing on Clients’ account may include agreed or discretionary bonuses and incentives, or any other sums not directly deposited by the Client or gained from trading on account of actually deposited funds (“Non-Deposited Funds”). Please note that unless otherwise explicitly agreed, Non-Deposited Funds are not available for withdrawal.
             <br>
          <br>
             <b> FEES AND CHARGES </b><br>
             The Company derives revenues from the spread on Transactions (i.e. the difference between buy/sell prices quotas offered by the Trading Platform to the Client).
<br>
The Company charges a fee for transfers and withdrawal of funds to and from the Trading Account.
<br>
The Company may introduce additional fees and charges and may change any existing fees and charges, at any time by giving the Client not less than 8 Business Days’ notice of such changes.
          <br>
          <br>
             <b>TRADING </b><br>
             The Trading Platform supplied by the Company enables trading in foreign exchange rates of different currencies, commodities, CFD’s, cryptocurrencies and other financial instruments made available by the company (all hereof: “Financial Instruments“).
<br>
The Trading Platform displays indicative quotes of exchange rates of different financial instruments pairs, based on different financial information systems. Due to different calculation methods and other circumstances, different trading platform and/or markets may display different price quotes. Prices posted on our website are provided by third party signal providers. We do not investigate, vet or warrant the performance or quality in any way of any third party pricing provider. All transactions, investments, and decisions are at your own discretion and risk.
<br>
The Company’s Trading Services are available during regular Forex Trading hours, Monday-Friday. Transactions are automatically renewed (“rolled over”) every night at 22:00 GMT from the day the Transaction is opened until the Transaction is closed. The Company does warrant that trading in the Trading Account will be available at all times.
<br>
The Client authorizes the Company to rely and act on any order, request, instruction or other communication given or made (or purporting to be given or made) by the Client or any person authorized on the Client’s behalf, without further enquiry on the part of the Company as to the authenticity, genuineness authority or identity of the person giving or purporting to give such order, request, instruction or other communication.
<br>
The Company has the right, but not the obligation, to set, at its absolute discretion, limits and/or parameters to control the Client’s ability to place orders or to restrict the terms on which a Transaction may be made.
<br>
The company does not allow arbitrage trading based on different systems or platforms in the markets, exploitation of system latency, bug, error or any other manipulative Trading methods that are designed to generate profits not from trading but from system manipulation or wrongful exploitation.
<br>
The company is entitled, by its own discretion, to cancel any trade that has been executed due or in connection with an error, system malfunction, breach of the Agreement by Client, etc. The company’s record will serve as decisive evidence to the correct exchange rates in the world markets and the wrong rate quote given to the client, and the company is entitled to correct or cancel any trade based on the correct exchange rates. The Client obligates to assist the Company in investigating any misuse of the Client’s Account.
<br>
Reporting – Client can view his open trades (“positions”) and margin funds at any time by accessing his account in the company’s platform and viewing historical trades in the Account.
<br>
The Trading Platform, Company’s website and other services may be used as intended only. Any other use as well as copying, reselling, reverse engineering or making unfair use of the Trading Platform, Company’s website and other services is strictly prohibited.
             <br>
          <br>
             <b>ROLLOVER AND MARGIN CALL, NO ADVICE </b><br>
             Rollovers or Swaps– a position is automatically renewed (‘rolled over’) at night, to the next business day, without the need for the Client’s intervention. Such rollovers are accommodated with interest debits or credits to the Trader’s Trading Account, based on the interest rate differentials applicable to each currency.
<br>
Margin call– In the event that the client fails or is expected to fail to meet the amounts required to secure his open trades, the Company may demand that the client shall deposit such sums as required (‘margin call’). In case the Client fails to meet such margin call, the Company may close out the Client’s position(s). The Client acknowledges and agrees that this may result in a Transaction being closed out at a less favourable time or rate than might otherwise be the case and the Company shall not have any liability to the Client as a result of it closing out any Transaction in such circumstances.
             <br>
          <br>
             <b style="font-size: 18px; text-decoration: none;">IMPORTANT: ACCOUNT HOLDER IS REQUIRED TO MONITOR ACCOUNT REGULARLY, AND ENSURE THAT AVAILABLE MARGIN EXISTS IN THE ACCOUNT PRIOR TO SUBMITTING THIS REQUEST, AS SUCH WITHDRAWAL MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON EXISTING OPEN POSITIONS OR TRADING STRATEGY USED. </b><br>
             The Company does not advise its clients in regard to the expected profitability of any trading order, and any tax or other consequences. The Client is solely responsible for making its own independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of the Transaction. The Client represents that it has sufficient knowledge, market sophistication and experience to make its own evaluation of the merits and risks of any Transaction. The Client acknowledges that he has read and understood the Risk Disclosure Document which sets out the nature and risks of Transactions to which this Agreement relates.
<br>
Where the Company does provide market commentary, E-books, tutorials, videos, webinars or other information: (a) this is incidental to the Client’s relationship with the Company (b) It is provided solely to enable the Client to make its own investment decisions; (c) makes no warranty that the information, at the time it has been received by Client, is still updated. The Company shall not be responsible for the consequences of the Client acting upon such market commentary or other information.
<br>
The Client acknowledges that the Company shall not, in the absence of its fraud or wilful default, be liable for any losses, costs, expenses or damages suffered by the Client arising from any inaccuracy or mistake in any information given to the Client.
<br>
The Company is under NO an obligation to assess the appropriateness of any Transaction for a Client, to assess whether or not the Client has the necessary knowledge and experience to understand the nature of and risks associated with the Transactions.
             <br>
          <br>
             <b>FURTHER COVENANTS</b><br>

            Risks and disclosure <span id="span_2">></span>
        </div>
        <div class="content_2 border">
            <p class="p-3">Prior to applying for an account, the Client should consider carefully whether trading in the Forex markets and the use of other services offered by the Company, is suitable for him in the light of his circumstances and financial resources and the risks described herein.

Trading in the Forex and other capital markets is considered risky and speculative. The leverage available in trading means that a relatively small movement can lead to a proportionately much larger movement in the size of any loss or profit. It can work against you as well as for you and lead to large losses as well as gains.

The relevant markets for Trading are characterized as high volatile markets, which inherits high risk, and may cause high loses to the deposit funds, and in a short period of time. The company is not and will not, in ANY way, be responsible to the trades executed, or not executed, by the Client.

The Client is ultimately responsible for all of the losses suffered in their account. As a consequence, the Client should be prepared to lose all the funds which he has deposited. The Client is also responsible for losses that exceed its profits and deposits. The Client should never fund his trading activities with retirement savings, loans, mortgages, emergency funds, funds set aside for purposes such as education or homeownership, or funds required for current income or present or future medical expenses.

Trading requires in-depth knowledge of the relevant markets, trading techniques and strategies. Therefore, a high level of investment and trading experience is necessary. No guarantees are offered or represented by the Company regarding the returns that can be expected from Trading.

The Client must know and follow the rules and regulations applicable to the Company’s Trading services as set forth in the documents and agreements delivered to and signed or approved (by way of internet approval) by the Client. Not following the rules and regulations applicable to Trading or any other applicable regulation may result in forced closure of positions (“Trades”), temporary freezing of the Client’s account, closing the account and/or other actions necessary for the protection of the Company.

Transaction Costs May Reduce Profit Taking. Be aware that every time an individual trade is placed, the Company profits from the Ask/Bid Spread. These transaction costs are a major cause of Traders not being able to increase their trading size and developing as a trader. The total daily/monthly/yearly commissions may add to losses and/or significantly impact and reduce profits.

Use of Leverage or Margin May be a Speculative and Costly Strategy. Trading using Margin is generally used by traders as a way to increase their purchasing power in order to be able to open a larger position without paying for it in full. Trading on leverage or margin, or the use of leverage generally, may result in losses beyond the initial investment or deposit. Extreme caution should be exercised relative to the Client’s use of a margin account.

Knowledge of Our Software Programs. The Client must be knowledgeable in the use and functionality of the Trading software provided by the Company, or by any third-party provider, in order to correctly interpret account information and to be able to place orders correctly. The Client shall be responsible for all orders placed in his account, regardless of his understanding of the system functionality. If the Client does not have a complete understanding of the way the system operates, he should not trade before obtaining the required knowledge.

Overnight Positions are considered Risky. Holding large positions, especially after the close of the relevant market (or in any case of cease of commerce, corporate events, freeze of trading on a security etc.), may result in considerable losses. Opening prices (next day or renew of commerce) can be significantly different from the previous closing prices; such prices changes may also significantly change the result of stop-loss orders.
